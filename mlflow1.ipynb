    "    MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle. It provides tools for experiment tracking, model management, and deployment, and it supports a variety of machine learning libraries. MLflow's main components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.MLflow Tracking: Tracks and logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts during model training, making it easier to compare different experiments and monitor their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.MLflow Projects: Helps organize reusable and reproducible projects by packaging machine learning code into a standardized format.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.MLflow Models: Facilitates the packaging and deployment of machine learning models in a consistent format for various environments like Docker, REST APIs, or even cloud services.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.MLflow Registry: A centralized model store to manage and track versions of models, stage them (e.g., \"staging\" or \"production\"), and annotate with metadata."
